# Configuration

:::note
The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). You'll have high availability, backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste, Typebot's founder.

The cloud version can save a substantial amount of developer time and resources. For most sites this ends up being the best value option and the revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development of Typebot. So youâ€™ll be supporting open source software and getting a great service!
:::

When running Typebot on your machine, the following configuration parameters can be supplied as environment variables.

Typebot is composed of 2 main applications:

- The builder, where you build your typebots
- The viewer, where your user answer the typebot

Both apps have their environment to configure properly:

- [Builder configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/builder)
- [Viewer configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/viewer)
