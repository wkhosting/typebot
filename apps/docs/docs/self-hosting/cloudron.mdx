# Cloudron

:::note
The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). You'll have high availability, backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, Baptiste, Typebot's founder.

The cloud version can save a substantial amount of developer time and resources. For most sites this ends up being the best value option and the revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development of Typebot. So youâ€™ll be supporting open source software and getting a great service!

## Requirements

You need a server with [Cloudron](https://www.cloudron.io/) installed and a machine with the [Cloudron CLI](https://docs.cloudron.io/packaging/cli/) installed.

## Installation

### 1. Download the compose file

On the machine that has the `cloudron` CLI, download the latest `CloudronManifest.json` file:

```sh
 wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/latest/packages/cloudron/CloudronManifest.json
```

### 2. Install the app

Install the app:

```sh
cloudron install --image baptistearno/typebot-cloudron:latest
```

## Configuration

You can further configure the app by opening the app File Manager in Cloudron and edit the `env.sh` file.

There, you can add any environment variable you want, like:

```sh
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="your_github_client_id"
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="your_github_client_secret"
```

Then restart the app to apply the changes.

## Update

To update the app, run:

```sh
cloudron update --app the_name_of_your_app --image baptistearno/typebot-cloudron:latest
```
