# Wait

The "Wait" block allows you to pause the conversation for a certain amount of seconds.

This can be useful if you want the bot to emphasize on what's been said or to wait before a redirection for example to make sure the user has read everything.

:::caution
This should be used wisely. If you want the bot to write slower or faster in a more general sense, you need to check the [Typing emulation settings](/editor/settings#typing-emulation)
