          I&apos;m passionate about great product UX and, during the first COVID
          lockdown, I decided to create my own Typeform alternative.

          Typebot was launched in July 2020. It is completely independent,
          self-funded, and bootstrapped. At the current stage, I&apos;m not
          interested in raising funds or taking investments.

          Because I love open-source SaaS, I decided in early 2022, alongside
          the launch of a major 2.0 release, to open-source the project
          entirely. Anyone can now read the source code and contribute to the
          project. You can also self-host your own version of Typebot on your
          server.

          With Typebot, I want to create the best bot-building experience. My
          goal is to empower you as a user and help you build great user
          experiences. Also, privacy comes first. While using Typebot, you
          aren&apos;t tracked by some third-party analytics tool.

          I&apos;m working hard on making a living from Typebot with a simple
          business model: <br />
          <br /> You can use the tool for free but your forms will contain a
          &quot;Made with Typebot&quot; small badge that potentially gets people
          to know about the product. If you want to remove it and also have
          access to other advanced features, you have to subscribe for $39 per
          month.
