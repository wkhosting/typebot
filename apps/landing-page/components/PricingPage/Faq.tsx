          What is considered a monthly chat?
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          A chat is counted whenever a user starts a discussion. It is
          independant of the number of messages he sends and receives. For
          example if a user starts a discussion and sends 10 messages to the
          bot, it will count as 1 chat. If the user chats again later and its
          session is remembered, it will not be counted as a new chat. <br />
          <br />
          An easy way to think about it: 1 chat equals to a row in your Results
          table

          What happens once I reach the monthly chats limit?
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          You will receive a heads up email when you reach 80% of your monthly
          limit. Once you have reached the limit, you will receive another email
          alert. Your bots will continue to run. You will be kindly asked to
          upgrade your subscription. If you don&apos;t provide an answer after
          ~48h, your bots will be closed for the remaining of the month. For a
          FREE workspace, If you exceed 600 chats, your bots will be
          automatically closed.

          What is considered as storage?
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          You accumulate storage for every file that your user upload into your
          bot. If you delete the associated result, it will free up the used
          space.

          When you exceed the storage size included in your plan, you will
          receive a heads up by email. There won&apos;t be any immediate
          additional charges and your bots will continue to store new files. If
          you continue to exceed the limit, you will be kindly asked you to
          upgrade your subscription.
